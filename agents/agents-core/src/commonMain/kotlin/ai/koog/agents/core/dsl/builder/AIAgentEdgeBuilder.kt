 * connecting two nodes in a graph of an AI agent's processing pipeline. This edge defines
 * the flow of data from a source node to a target node, enabling transformation or filtering
 * of the source node's output before passing it to the target node.
 *
 * @param IncomingOutput The type of output produced by the source node connected to this edge.
 * @param OutgoingInput The type of input accepted by the target node connected to this edge.
 * @constructor This builder should only be constructed internally using intermediate configuration.
 *
 * @property edgeIntermediateBuilder The intermediate configuration used for building the edge. It includes
 * the source and target nodes, as well as the functionality for processing the output of the source node.
